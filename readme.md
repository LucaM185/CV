# Luca Miglioli - Projects

## Web Development
1. **Manim Studio**
   - Frontend to quickly create animations with manim (python library) and gpt4-turbo

   - Video demo: https://github.com/LucaM185/CV/assets/66442521/416b3874-d456-45ad-a035-3d09ca6e496d

## Computer vision, detection and arduino control
2. **STEM**
   - Ball balancing software and hardware, a camera uses computer vision to find the ball, advanced processing finds with sub pixel precision the position of the ball, the future potition is estimated and it controls the position and velocity of two stepper motors with microstepping. Most mechanical parts (motor mounts, hooks...) were 3d printed.

## Data Science - macchine learning
3. **Transformer**
   - Transformer network architecture with attention
   - [Transformer repo](https://github.com/LucaM185/MLgit)

4. **Sudoku**
   - Screenshot to solved sudoku with ML digit recognition + backtracking
   - Note: i made my own data labeler (python cv2/numpy) and dataset with augmentation (pytorch)  
   - [Sudoku Repo](https://github.com/LucaM185/MagicSudokuSolver)

5. **Conv Visuals**
   - Simple Convolutional network (pytorch) trained on mninst with visualisations (python cv2)
   - Video Demo: https://github.com/LucaM185/CV/assets/66442521/17c4c693-2c48-4312-ad03-25083dc4a128
